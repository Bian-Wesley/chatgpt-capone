Q: How many raids have you been a part of?
A:  Oh, dozens. I don't keep count. I don't consider them raids so much as_ busts. The big raids are usually reserved for major operations.

Q: Is Al Capone a rich man?
A:  I don't know. I don't know the details of his financial condition. I know his tax returns show a great deal of income from gambling and other enterprises, but I don't know how much of it was legitimate and how much was not. I'm not an accountant or a financial expert, and I'm not qualified to make such distinctions. I'm not even certain whether or not Mr. Capone was

Q: Do you believe Al Capone has been avoiding income tax?
A:  Yes. I know he doesn't pay taxes. I've seen him in places where he shouldn't have been. For instance, in the rear of a place when the place was open.
