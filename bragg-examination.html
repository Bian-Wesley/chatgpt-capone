<strong>Green:</strong> Do you know Alphonse Capone?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Point him out, please?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> That gentleman with the dark blue suit and blue tie [indicating Capone].<br><strong>Green:</strong> Describe your first meeting with Capone.<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> In 1925 I was with a group from the West Suburban Ministers' and Citizens' Association on a raid at 4818 West 22nd Street, Cicero. It was the Saturday of Derby Day, in the month of May.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Did you have any conversation with the defendant?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Who was present?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> A number of people of the raiding party and some of the employees of the place, inside the saloon.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Describe the conversation.<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> Well, my job was to watch the front door and keep anybody from going in or out. A big powerful man tried to get in and finally forced the door open. I got sore and asked him, "What the hell do -you think this is, a party?" and he said, "Well, it ought to be a party, I'm the owner of this place." So I said,<br>"Come on in, Al, we're waiting for you."<br><strong>Green:</strong> What did the defendant do then?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> He went upstairs with Mr. Morgan, one of the raiding party.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Did you have any later conversation with the defendant?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> Well, I was present at several conversations. One was upstairs when Capone asked Mr. Morgan and the Reverend Mr. Hoover why they were always picking on him. "Why don't you lay off of me in Cicero?" he said, and Mr. Hoover said they were not picking on him. "This is the last raid you'll ever pull on me," Capone said.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Describe what you saw upstairs?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> There were roulette wheels, pool, billiard and crap tables, and chuck-a-luck outfits.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Did you see Capone again?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> Yes, when Judge Hamilton of LaGrange, who was with us, was asked to issue a warrant for him. Shortly after that Capone disappeared.
