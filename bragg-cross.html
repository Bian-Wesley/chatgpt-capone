<strong>Ahern:</strong> What's chuck-a-luck?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> I don't know.<br><strong>Ahern:</strong> Then you can't say whether there were chuck-a-luck outfits there?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> I mean I don't know' exactly. It's something like a parrot's cage and dice roll in the center.<br><strong>Ahern:</strong> In how many raids have' you taken part?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> I was on another one in Stickney.<br><strong>Ahern:</strong> Was there any attempt made to arrest Capone in the raid at 4818 West 22nd Street?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> I don't know. I didn't see any.<br><strong>Ahern:</strong> Were others arrested?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> Warrants were drawn for the minor help.<br><strong>Ahern:</strong> You saw no warrant drawn for the man who said he was the owner of the place?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> There was a demand made for the warrant and I saw a man start to draw it, but before the warrant was ready Capone was gone.<br><strong>Ahern:</strong> Why was the warrant not served?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> I don't pretend to know the intricacies of the law in such cases.<br><strong>Ahern:</strong> Oh, you suspect that there was skullduggery, do you?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> I know it was a rotten job not to go through with the arrest.<br><strong>Ahern:</strong> How do you have such a distinct recollection of this raid?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> Well, if you had your face busted like I did you wouldn't forget it for a while.<br><strong>Ahern:</strong> Oh, you were beaten up? Where was that?<br><strong>Bragg:</strong> Outside, as I was leaving. My nose was broken by a blackjack or brass knuckle....
