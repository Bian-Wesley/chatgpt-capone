<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> [Showing Smith some hotel records] I ask you if you ever saw these sheets?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> I made them out. When they paid me money, I put it down.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> Here's a record here for $1500, dated March 25th, 1927, for the rooms occupied by Mr. Capone, is that right?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Yes.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> How long was that for?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> That was on account.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> Under what name did Capone register?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Under the name of Mr. Ross.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> Here's an entry for Mr. Ross, on September 4th, 1927, $150 for rooms and $650 for incidentals. Was that in cash?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Yes.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fink:</strong> I don't see how that's material if it's just an effort to show that the defendant spent money.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Court:</strong> I suspect that's just exactly what it is. If there's money going out, there is a presumption that, it is coming in.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> Here's an entry for Mr. Ross on September 28th, 1927, an entry of $1633, what was that for?</p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> For a party of friends.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> Ever see Jack Guzik there?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Yes.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> How would Capone pay his bills?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> In cash, bills.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> What denominations?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> The ordinary denominations used by Uncle Sam.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> Well, how large?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Oh hundred dollar bills, sometimes five hundred dollar bills.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> Ever see Al distribute any tips?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Oh, yes, he distributed small gratuities; sometimes he gave me small gratuities.<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Grossman:</strong> How much?<br><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Smith:</strong> Oh, five dollars or so.</p>
