<p><strong>Green:</strong> What is your occupation?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> Minister of the gospel.<br><strong>Green:</strong>Do you know the defendant Alphonse Capone?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> Yes. There he is [pointing at Capone].<br><strong>Green:</strong>When did you first see him?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> On a Saturday afternoon in May, 1925, at 4818 West 22nd. That was a gambling establishment.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Where in this establishment did you see him?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> In the main gambling hall on the second floor, and later back behind the partition, in a back room.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Describe the second floor.<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> It was a large hall, with gambling apparatus, chairs, and racing forms, and then to the rear a partition shut off a back room.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Where on the second floor did you first see the defendant?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> I was in the larger hall. I saw him first when he came up the stairway, into the hall, and disappeared into the back room.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Did the defendant say anything upon entering the hall?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> Yes, he said, “This is the last raid you'll ever pull.”<br><strong>Green:</strong> Did you see him again?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> Yes, I followed him into the back room. When I saw him then he was taking the money out of the till and putting it into his pockets.<br><strong>Green:</strong>Did you talk with the defendant at this time?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> Yes, I said to Lieutenant Davidson, “Who is this man?” and Mr. Capone raised his head and replied, “I'm Al Brown, if that's good enough for you.” I said, “Oh, I thought it was someone like that, someone more powerful than the President of the United States.”<br><strong>Green:</strong> What else did the defendant say?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> He said, “Why are you fellows always picking on me?” I told him. this was not a personal matter, that we were simply trying to uphold the law in the western suburbs.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Did you see the defendant at a later time on the same day in this establishment?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> Yes.<br><strong>Green:</strong> What did he say, if, anything?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> He said, “Reverend, can't you and I get together - come to some understanding?” I asked him what he meant, and he said, “If you will let up on me in Cicero, I'll withdraw from Stickney.” I said, “Mr. Capone, the only understanding you and I can have is that you must obey the law or get out of the western suburbs.”<br><strong>Green:</strong> How did the defendant appear on this occasion, when you first saw him?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> He was dressed as though he had just gotten out of bed, with a pajama shirt and a suit of clothes. He was unshaven.<br><strong>Green:</strong> Was there ever any reference made to any particular place in Stickney by the defendant? <strong>Hoover:</strong> Not specifically, but it was quite apparent to me that what he referred to was the raiding of the Harlem Inn.<br><strong>Court:</strong> What had you raided in Stickney?<br><strong>Hoover:</strong> The Harlem Inn, a vice resort, and other places.</p>
